  Step 1: Open your Terminal and Connect to PostgreSQL

  First, make sure your PostgreSQL server is running. (You previously started it with
  brew services start postgresql@14).

  Now, open your terminal and connect to the default postgres database. This database
  usually exists by default and allows you to manage other databases and users.

You are now in the psql interactive shell. You should see a prompt like postgres=# or
  your_system_username=#.

  Step 2: Create a New User (Role) with a Password

  In the psql prompt, type the following command to create a new user (PostgreSQL
  calls them "roles"). Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_PASSWORD.

   1 CREATE USER YOUR_USERNAME WITH PASSWORD 'YOUR_PASSWORD';

  Example:

   1 CREATE USER myappuser WITH PASSWORD 'my_strong_secure_password';

  Press Enter after typing the command. You should see CREATE ROLE if successful.

  Step 3: Create a New Database and Assign Ownership

  Next, create a new database and make the user you just created the owner of this
  database. Replace YOUR_DATABASE_NAME and YOUR_USERNAME.

   1 CREATE DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME OWNER YOUR_USERNAME;

  Example:

   1 CREATE DATABASE iswmc_data OWNER myappuser;

  Press Enter. You should see CREATE DATABASE if successful.

  Step 4: Grant All Privileges on the Database to the User

  It's good practice to explicitly grant all necessary permissions to your
  application user on its database. Replace YOUR_DATABASE_NAME and YOUR_USERNAME.

   1 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME TO YOUR_USERNAME;

  Example:

   1 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE iswmc_data TO myappuser;

  Press Enter. You should see GRANT if successful.


  Step 5: Exit `psql`

  To leave the psql interactive shell, type:

   1 \q

  Press Enter.



  Step 6: How to See (Verify) Your New User and Database

  You can verify that your user and database were created by connecting to PostgreSQL
  again.


   1. Connect to PostgreSQL as the `postgres` superuser (or your system user):

âœ¦  2. List all users (roles):
      In the psql prompt, type:

   1     \du

      Press Enter. You should see a list of roles, including YOUR_USERNAME you just
  created.

   3. List all databases:
      In the psql prompt, type:

   1     \l

      Press Enter. You should see a list of databases, including YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
  you just created, with YOUR_USERNAME as its owner.

   4. Exit `psql`:

   1     \q

  Summary of your new credentials:


   * Username: YOUR_USERNAME (the one you chose in Step 2)
   * Password: YOUR_PASSWORD (the one you chose in Step 2)
   * Database Name: YOUR_DATABASE_NAME (the one you chose in Step 3)

  Use these credentials to update your .env file for your application's DATABASE_URL.
