GENERAL APP DESCRIPTION

I would like to build a node.js based data collection application that willl eventually be served to the web.
Its is the Greenviro SPAJ ISWMC Operation Data Programs.
Although its one program it has 5 different section to collect data for different facility in the ISWMC.
The six sections are Security Guard Post (SGP), Weighbridge (WBS), Material Recovery Facility (MRF), Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP), Anaerobic Digester (ADS), Depot Repair Area (DRA).
We will build one by one over time building on the project.
I would like the database to using SQL.
In general all six modules are on the same web but different page collecting datas, stored in SQL.
The data is then used to provide data visualization on the web page.
