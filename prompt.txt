GENERAL APP DESCRIPTION

I would like to build a node.js based data collection application that willl eventually be served to the web.
Its is the Greenviro SPAJ ISWMC Operation Data Programs.
Although its one program it has 5 different section to collect data for different facility in the ISWMC.
The six sections are Security Guard Post (SGP), Weighbridge (WBS), Material Recovery Facility (MRF), Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP), Anaerobic Digester (ADS), Depot Repair Area (DRA).
We will build one by one over time building on the project.
I would like the database to using SQL.
In general all six modules are on the same web but different page collecting datas, stored in SQL.
The data is then used to provide data visualization on the web page.

THE FIELDS AREA

SECURITY GUARD POST (SGP)
A window for auto selecting the date and day.
Here are the seven fields for the user to key in by typing.
Name, From Company, Purpose Of Visit, Phone Number, ID Number, Email Address, PIC To Meet

Material Recovery Facility (MRF)
Here are the fields for the user to key in by selecting a dropdown menu.
A window for auto selecting the date and day.
Sevem Different sections namely Trucks, Incoming Tonnage, Outgoing Tonnage, Grappler A, Grappler B
Date: A dropdown menu to select date, day display is automatic

Outgoing Tonnage: Has Two Types namely: Organic Output (ton), Inert Output (ton),
    Both Incoming and Outgoing Tonnage qty selectable dropdown selection start from 0 to 500.
Grappler A: Number of Grabs (qty), Mode (Auto or Manual, Running (Hours), Downtime (Hrs), Working (Hours)
Grappler B: Number of Grabs (qty), Mode (Auto or Manual, Running (Hours), Downtime (Hrs), Working (Hours)
    Those with qty units has dropdown menu from 0 to 500, Those with hours unit has values of 0 to 24

Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP)
Here are the fields for the user to key in.
By selecting a dropdown menu - Operation (Hours), Flowrate (meter cube), Incoming Flow meter cube), Treated Final Discharge (Meter Cube)
By typing in comments - Issues

Issues & Concerns

For Weighbridge (WBS), Anaerobic Digester (ADS), Depot Repair Area (DRA) put a place holder for this 3 for later development.

APP STYLING

I would like the app to be simple, white background and black text
I must be desktop and mobile friendly
Able to work on all web browser particularly Chrome, Safari, Firefox.

Add Home Button to All Pages.

On the home page. Add below "Depot Repair Area" a selection button marked "See Data". When clicked the "See Data" button, it goes to       │
a page named "Stored Data". On this "Stored Data" page, its shows pass seven days data of SGP, MFR, LTP, WBS, ADS, DRA in a table format. Add a "Home" button on the       │
"Stored Data" page similar to the "Home" button on other pages.

Add one new page named Data Visualization
In the home page underneath the See Data Button, Add a link to go to the Data Visualization Page
In the Data Visualization Page Have This Items Summary Collected From The Database
